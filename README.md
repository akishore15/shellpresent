# About ShellPresent
ShellPresent is an alternative to PowerPoint, but it is not too useful, like it does not have any advanced slide editing, but you can fork this repository and modify the Svelte code.
# Pros and Cons
**Pros**:
- P: You can experiment with it
Q: Why?
- A: Because PowerPoint has a *lot* of source code, it is not good for experimenting with.
- P: It's an amazing start!
- Q: Why?
- A: It has not a lot of functions, so it has less source code, which means that you can go crazy and get the hang of some PowerPoint techniques.
**Cons**:
- C: It is not PowerPoint!
- Q: In what ways?
- A: It naturally does not have all the source code of PowerPoint or Google Slides, and that is just to start with! There are so many other cons!
